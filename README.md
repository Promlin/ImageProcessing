## Features Detectors

Feature point - is some points that could be easily detected on the image. They could have some unique forms or colors, that let us find its in the scene.
We could find objects on the scene by using its. 

[Some application examples show how to use feature points and match object with the scene](FeaturesDetectors/examples.md)
