# Features Detectors

Feature point - is some points that could be easily detected on the image. They could have some unique forms or colors, that let us find its in the scene.
We could find objects on the scene by using its. 

# SIFT Detector

SIFT stands for Scale-Invariant Feature Transform. 
A convenient method that allows you to implement the search for a fragment in the image, taking into account changes in the size of this fragment.

# ORB Detection

ORB detector is a fusion of FAST feature point detector and BRIEF descriptor with many modifications to enhance the detector performance.

The image shows the matching of feature point and gives a visual representation of the purpose of these points.
